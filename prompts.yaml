  Check if CLAUDE.md exists in the project root.

  If CLAUDE.md already exists and looks complete, read it and output its contents
  as your response. Do NOT recreate or overwrite it.

  If CLAUDE.md does not exist or is incomplete, analyze this codebase thoroughly.
  Read all key files, understand the architecture, patterns, tech stack, module
  structure, and design decisions. Then write your analysis to CLAUDE.md with:
  - Project overview and purpose
  - Tech stack and dependencies
  - Architecture and module structure
  - Key design patterns and conventions
  - Data flow and component relationships
  - Entry points and important files

  Be thorough and reference specific files and functions.

  IMPORTANT: Your final message must be complete and self-contained.
  Output the full contents of CLAUDE.md as your final response.
