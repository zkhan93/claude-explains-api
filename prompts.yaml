  Analyze this codebase thoroughly. Read all key files, understand the architecture,
  patterns, tech stack, module structure, and design decisions.

  Write your complete analysis to a file called CLAUDE.md in the project root.
  The file should contain:
  - Project overview and purpose
  - Tech stack and dependencies
  - Architecture and module structure
  - Key design patterns and conventions
  - Data flow and component relationships
  - Entry points and important files

  This file will be used as context for future questions about this codebase,
  so be thorough and reference specific files and functions.

  After creating CLAUDE.md, output its contents as your final response.
