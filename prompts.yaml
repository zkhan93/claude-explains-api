  Analyze this codebase thoroughly. Read all key files, understand the architecture,
  patterns, tech stack, module structure, and design decisions.

  Write your complete analysis to a file called CLAUDE.md in the project root.
  The file should contain:
  - Project overview and purpose
  - Tech stack and dependencies
  - Architecture and module structure
  - Key design patterns and conventions
  - Data flow and component relationships
  - Entry points and important files

  This file will be used as context for future questions about this codebase,
  so be thorough and reference specific files and functions.

  IMPORTANT: Your final message must be complete and self-contained.
  After creating CLAUDE.md, output its full contents as your final response.
  Do not reference previous messages — include everything in your last response.
